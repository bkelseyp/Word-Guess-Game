# Psychic-Guess-Game
Homework, Week 3

__Overview of Game__
Inside you'll find my attempts at completing the recommend hangman game and the completed psychic game. I had pieces and parts, but they weren't all fitting together properly. I plan on going back and reviewing my code to find the correct solution for the hangman game. 
After many failed attempts and the approaching deadline, I started on the Psychic homework. It was was easier to code because of my earlier attempts at the hangman game.
